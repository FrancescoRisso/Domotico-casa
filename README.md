# Domotico-casa

This prototype reads data from Dinergy (heating/cooling control system) and Bticino (home automation control system, very experimental).
This allows storing in a database all the data coming from the above systems, showing all the historical data and trends (with Grafana).

The system is not flexible enough to be deployed as is in different conditions (e.g., another house); it this case the source code may require some small modifications and adaptations.
